## Introduction

This document provides a breakdown of the project design plan for the HyperBook Application.  The HyperBoop Application provides customers with the ability to book an itinerary to use the Hyperloop travel service.  Each itinerary is made up of one or more routes assigned to particular time slot(s).  When the customer chooses a particular itinerary, they can provide payment details to pay and reserve their travel plan.  Once completed, the user can lookup their itinerary to get details about it.


## Purpose & Objectives

The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed specification for the HyperBook Application design including architecture, flowcharts, diagrams, and test cases.  The information contained will be used to guide the development of the application and measure success criteria for the final completed version.

#### Application Components

##### List of API Methods

- login
	- Parameters: email, password
	- Response: Success/Failure Code
		- If Success: user_id, email
		- If Failure: redirect back to login
	- Logic: You have to match the email and password against the user details in the DB. Use SHA-512 with salt for hashing the password and storing in DB.
- get_username
	- Parameters: user_id
	- Response: first_name, last_name
	- Logic: To get the full name and may be other static details about the user to show on the account page of the user.
- get_trips
	- Parameters: user_id
	- Response: list of trips. Each reservation is an object of:
		- trip_id
		- departure_city
		- destination_city
		- price_paid
		- trip_image
			- A side by side image, as seen in the demo
		- date_of_travel
	- Logic: API to get the list of bookings of the specified user arranged in an order. The most recent booking should be first in the list.
- get_cities
	- Parameters: none
	- Response: an object of all operating cities, each of which contains:
		- city_id
		- city_name
		- coordinates [lon, lat]
- get_destinations
	- Parameters: city_id
	- Response: a list of city_idâ€™s that can be traveled to from the city_id passed
- get_pod_schedules
	- Parameters: departure_city_id, destination_city_id
	- Response: an object of three PodSchedules, each of which contains:
		- pod_schedule_id
		- departure_time
		- arrival_time
		- price
	- Logic: With the cities passed, return a list of pod_schedules between the two cities. There will only ever be 3 pod_schedules per valid city itinerary.
- get_account_autofill_info
	- Parameters: user_id
	- Response: object of:
		- name
		- email
		- addressline1
		- addressline2
		- city
		- state
		- zip_code
	- Logic: When we pass in the user_id we will get the account details as mentioned above for that user to autofill in the payment screen.

#### Test Cases

The HyperBook Application makes use of .NET Core API endpoints hosted in Azure for backend functionality.  These will be tested for proper functionality including the following checks:

- GET requests return expected values with correct data types and structures.
- POST requests are validated by the application, and processed correctly to update any relevant data.

Specific tests to be performed using the functionality of the frontend are detailed below:

| Tested Function           | Input                      | Expected Output            | Actual Output | Pass? |
|---------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|---------------|-------|
| Logging in to application | User, Password             | One success, one failure   | TBD           |  TDB  |
| Choose travel options     | FromCity, ToCity, Schedule | Valid trip                 | TBD           |  TDB  |
| Pay and book a trip       | Valid trip, payment info   | Confirmation email, status | TBD           |  TDB  |
| Cancel a prior trip       | Booked trip                | Cancellation of trip       | TBD           |  TDB  |
| Modify account info       | Address info, phone        | Successful change          | TBD           |  TDB  |
| List a user's trips       | Logged in, choose menu     | List of booked trips       | TBD           |  TDB  |
