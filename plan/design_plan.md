## Introduction

This document provides a breakdown of the project design plan for the HyperBook Application.  The HyperBoop Application provides customers with the ability to book an itinerary to use the Hyperloop travel service.  Each itinerary is made up of one or more routes assigned to particular time slot(s).  When the customer chooses a particular itinerary, they can provide payment details to pay and reserve their travel plan.  Once completed, the user can lookup their itinerary to get details about it.


## Purpose & Objectives

The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed specification for the HyperBook Application design including architecture, flowcharts, diagrams, and test cases.  The information contained will be used to guide the development of the application and measure success criteria for the final completed version.
